Completed Challenge for Big Nerd Ranch iOS Programming Silver Challenge for Chapter 18

The angle of the drawn line determines the colour of the line. Lines are represented using a line struct: Line.swift. A computed property added to the Line struct was utilized to record the angle of the line .
Lines with a positive angle are drawn in green and lines with a negative angle are drawn in blue.
