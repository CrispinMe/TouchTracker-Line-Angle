# TouchTracker-Line-Angle
Chapter 18 Silver Challenge - Colours
Completed Challenge for Big Nerd Ranch iOS Programming Silver Challenge for Chapter 18

The angle of the drawn line determines the colour of the line. Lines are represented using a line struct: Line.swift. A computed property to record the line angle was added to the Line struct.
Lines with a positive angle are drawn in green and lines with a negative angle are drawn in blue.
